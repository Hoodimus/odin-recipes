			<h3>Melt-In-Your-Mouth Meatloaf</h3>
			<p>This slow cooker meatloaf recipe is simple and foolproof! With a sweet, sticky glaze brushed on during the last 15 minutes, every bite of this comfort-food classic is moist, juicy, and full of flavor.

			<p>If you've never made meatloaf in the slow cooker, it's time to remedy that ASAP. This aptly named recipe — which cooks low and slow to tender, juicy perfection — actually does melt in your mouth.</p>
			<p>The Crock-Pot might not be the traditional way to cook meatloaf, but there are plenty of reasons to try the slow cooker method ASAP. The Allrecipes community loves this meatloaf recipe for its ease: Just shape the meatloaf, toss it in the slow cooker, and add the glaze before serving. It's that simple! Plus, you can prepare this meal in the morning and save yourself from the after-work dinner struggle. Of course, the slow cooker also ensures a perfectly tender and melt-in-your mouth texture that is much harder to achieve in the oven.

		<h4>Steps</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare meatloaf: Whisk together milk, bread crumbs, eggs, minced onion, salt, and sage in a large bowl. Stir in ground beef and mushrooms until well combined.</li>
			<li>Shape mixture into a round loaf. Place loaf into a 5-quart slow cooker.</li>
			<li>Cover and cook on Low until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 5 to 6 hours.</li>
			<li>Prepare glaze: Whisk ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl.</li>
			<li>Open the slow cooker and spoon glaze over the meatloaf. Cover the cooker and continue to cook on Low until sauce is heated through, about 15 minutes.</li>
			<li>Carefully remove meatloaf with two spatulas to a serving plate. Cover with foil and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
		</ol>
		<h5>Tip:</h5>
		<p>A foil sling can make it easier to remove the meatloaf from the cooker. Lay several long strips of heavy-duty aluminum foil in a criss-cross pattern in the bottom of your slow cooker. The strips should come up to the top of the cooker. Place meatloaf on top. When finished cooking, lift meatloaf carefully using the foil as handles, and transfer to a platter.</p>
		<p>ENJOY!</p>
